## Summary

I am postdoctoral scholar at the California Institute of Technology working at Michael Elowitz' laboratory. My main projects relate to single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis at the level of signaling pathways in developmental contexts. 
In this website I collect data related projects, academic work and photography and other non-academic projects.
